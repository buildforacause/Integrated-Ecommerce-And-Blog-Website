# Integrated-Ecommerce-And-Blog-Website
An integrated shop + blog website made using Django. The main folder contains two apps of Django namely blog and shop described below:


# SHOP
The shop part of the website represents an e-commerce website's clone. It has products to be displayed in the home page so that user can browse through different products. The products are queried from database of Django and are displayed using Jinja templating.

The cart of the e-commerce website is made completely using JavaScript by using it's localStorage property. The frontend of both the websites is majorly taken from Bootstrap to reduce the styling work and focusing on backend. Both the websites are responsive.

# BLOG
The blog part of the website contains sample blogs with a facebook like plugin integrated on each of the blogpost. The homepage contains genres of the blogs and each blogpost page contains next and previous buttons to navigate through the blogs. Logic for this is implemented via Jinja templating!
